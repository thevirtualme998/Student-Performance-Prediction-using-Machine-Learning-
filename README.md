# Student-Performance-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict student performance based on various academic and socio-economic factors using Pythonâ€™s machine learning and data analysis libraries.

The workflow involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

By predicting student scores, we can identify key factors influencing performance and suggest actionable interventions.

### Objectives
Perform EDA to understand relationships between features and student scores.

Preprocess data: handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features.

Train regression models to predict student performance.

Evaluate models using error metrics and statistical scores.

Interpret model coefficients to understand feature importance.
